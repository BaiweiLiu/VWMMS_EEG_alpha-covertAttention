Simplified codes for the paper "Functional but not obligatory link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention" Baiwei Liu, Anna C. Norbe, Freek van Ede. These codes are written in Matlab R2021 and based on the eeg and eyelinker data that extracted by Fieldtrip. Thus, to use these codes, you need to use Fieldtrip to read and epoch data first or provide a data containing similiar information. The core function of PBlab_gazepos2shift_1D and PBlab_gazeShift_rate_size_1d are written for general use and do not rely on other scripts and the data extracted by Fieldtrip.

creatDir.m and get_subFiles.m are general codes that called in other main codes (get_saccadeEvent.m, sortTrial_onSaccade.m, get_lateralisation.m).

To run these codes, you can change the path where you put the code and the data at the beginning of these codes.

You can run these codes in following order to replicate the main results in "Functional but not obligatory link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention":

1. run get_saccadeEvent.m to detect gaze shift from raw gaze postion data; and then plot the shift size and shift rate figure (figure 1c in the paper) to check whether the detected saccades are microsaccade. 

2. run sortTrial_onSaccade.m to sort the trial into 'toward' 'away' 'no micorsaccade' based on the direction of detected microsaccades. 

3. run get_lateralisation.m to get the lateralisation of power in these three types of trials.
