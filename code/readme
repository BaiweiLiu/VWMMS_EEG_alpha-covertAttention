These codes are written in Matlab R2021.

The core function: "PBlab_gazepos2shift_1D" transforms gaze-position data to gaze-shift data, and is written for general use. It is compatible with any data in matrix format (trials x time).

The remaining codes regard additional analyses of eeg and eyelink data that were extracted in Fieldtrip. To use these codes, your data should resemble fieldtrip data structures.

creatDir.m and get_subFiles.m are general codes that called in other main codes (get_saccadeEvent.m, sortTrial_onSaccade.m, get_lateralisation.m).

To run these codes, you can change the path where you put the code and the data at the beginning of these codes.

You can run these codes in following order:

1. run get_saccadeEvent.m to detect gaze shift from raw gaze postion data; and then plot the shift size and shift rate figure (figure 1c in the paper) to check whether the detected saccades are microsaccade. 

2. run sortTrial_onSaccade.m to sort the trial into 'toward' 'away' 'no micorsaccade' based on the direction of detected microsaccades. 

3. run get_lateralisation.m to get the lateralisation of power in these three types of trials.
